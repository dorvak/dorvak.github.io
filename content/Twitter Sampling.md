Summary: Sampling YouTube-Clips from the Twitter-API
Category: Blog

During the  electoral campaigning for the recent german federal elections in
2013, we decided not just to monitor YouTube-Clips via _classical_ sampling
techniques like keyword-searches on YouTube. Therefore, we took advantage of the
[cross-pollinated](http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6932) diffusion processes between
Social Network Sites (SNS) like Facebook or - in this case - Twitter:

To gain an understanding of which YouTube-Clips are relevant in terms of
political participation and discussion on Twitter, we collected Tweets which are
related to the federal elections, resolved the URLS within those Tweets and - if
an URL linked to a YouTube-Clip - included these Clips in our YouTube-Election
sample. This method enables the _early-bird_ detection of (likely) political
YouTube-Clips and supplements the more traditional data-collection process via
YouTube search terms, channel monitoring or crawling the YouTube-Network of
related videoclips



## Collecting political Tweets via Streaming-API

Twitter, as opposed to Facebook as a less accessible SNS in terms of crawling
topics, posts and alike, became sort of a favourite toy for the social
science/information science etc. To a very large extend, Twitter (comparetivly)
open API's and a vast collection of tool/websites to get data out of the system
may account for this affinity towards the quite small SNS - when compared to
Facebook. However, although Twitter-Users might be completely un-representative,
there is a potential of Twitter as an early-warning system, ifnluential intra-
media-agenda-setting authority. When dealing with the dissemination of
(political) content,
[we](https://speakerdeck.com/dorvak/news-diffusion-ecrea-2012) can
show that news-articles disseminate lamost an order of magnitude faster on
Twitter than on Facebook.

Therefore, we conclude that Twitter is sort of a news-ticker, while Facebook is
used for the discussion of links and content within smaller ['personal
publics'](http://www.schmidtmitdete.de/english-content). This holds true for the
diffusion of audiovisual-content as well: Tweets for YouTube-Clips usually
precede the Shares, Likes and Comments on Facebook (see one example above).


WhatÂ´s crucial here and should not be underestimated is the *flow of content*
not only *within* SNS, but *across* different online-outlets. These *cross-
pollination* process might be triggered by users who uses both multiple networks
and once (Studies?) and disseminate content/links  - like bee's transport pollen
- into other networks. Of course, users who do create content on platforms like
YouTube tend to use Twitter and Facebook (Study) and therefore *pollute* other
SNS intentionally (which links to the concept of virality ..). From a more
abstract, system-theoretical viewpoint, social or communicative subsystems like
Twitter and Facebook observe and react to each other (again, Twitter is more
observable than Facebook, f.e.).

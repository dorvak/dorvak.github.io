  "description": "Fetch basic video statistics for a given YouTube-Video\n\n1. Obtain an API-Key: The v3-API is OAuth-based, by default. To get such a key, you must register as a Google [Developer](https://developers.google.com/) and create an app/project that uses the YouTube-API. See the https://console.developers.google.com/ for more information about how to create an project, it's simple and straighforward. \n\n2. Once you created an App and activated the YouTube-API for that app or project, you have to obtain the public API-access key to authenticate your requests with the Facepager (like you do if you login with your Facebook or Twitter-credentials, also this is purely OAuth-based). The key is located in the \"credentials\"-section\n\n3. Copy the public API access key\n\n4. Load the \"YouTube API v3\" presets in the Facepager & paste the key in the paramter field (as you might guess, as a value of the \"key\"-parameter, \"XY\" by default).\n\n5. You're now read to start with the YouTube-API.  The only information you need to provide is the ID of a YouTube-Video (\"https://www.youtube.com?v=HEREISTHEID\") and add it as a node to the main window (\"Add Node\"-Button, you may copy a list of nodes in here).\n\n"
